**Comments:**
- Difference between `TArray::Add` and `TArray::Emplace`  The main difference between `TArray::Add()` and `TArray::Emplace()` is that `Add()` copies or moves the passed element into the array, while `Emplace()` constructs the element in place.
- What is the Interface  
  If a `class` is a description of the object itself in OOP, then an `interface` is a description of a set of its actions.
